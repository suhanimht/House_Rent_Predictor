# House_Rent_Predictor
##Overview
There is a rise in demand for renting a house and buying a house therefore , determining  a more efficient way to calculate the house rents is crucial. House rent increases once a year, So there's a desire to predict house rents within the future . House rent prediction system studies behavior of your time series data and reflects the long run rents. Software implementations for the experiment were selected from python libraries. Data preprocessing and preparation techniques so as to get clean data. To make machine learning models ready to predict house price supported house features to research and compare models performance so as to decide on the simplest model. We applied three different Machine Learning algorithms: Decision tree, Random forest and Linear Regression on the training data.

##Introduction to problem:
In recent times, finding the ideal housing option according to budget and preferences is such a hassle. The cost of house rent depends on many factors such as; the house size, number of bedrooms, locality, number of bathrooms, halls, and kitchen, furnishing status, and a lot more. The prediction of house rents plays a crucial role in real estate and property management. Having an accurate estimate of house rents can assist both tenants and landlords in making informed decisions. With the use of appropriate machine learning algorithms, users can find the ideal house according to their budgets and preferences with ease.
